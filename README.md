# EcoShower ðŸš¿ðŸŒ±

EcoShower is a shower tracking web app aimed at anyone who showers and wants to track the environmental impact of their showers. One of the simplest ways to live more sustainably is to take shorter showers, as long showers are harmful to the environment due to wasting water, consuming lots of energy, and worsening climate change by increasing greenhouse gas emissions (through heating the water), so Ecoshower is meant to encourage shorter showers for more sustainable living. 

The app includes a stopwatch that you start when you take a shower and stop when you finished the shower. After the shower, you can see information about the duration, amount of water used, carbon dioxide emissions (assuming the water is heated), and average water bill cost of the shower based on how long it took to shower. There is also a section where you can input in shower duration goals, as well as messages/reminders that a robot voice would say out loud during the shower (e.g. if you want to transition from using shampoo to conditioner at a certain time point) to keep you accountable and under your desired time limit. 

I made Ecoshower in a day to practice using React.js and Firebase. That's why it's a web app instead of a mobile app (because I don't have a lot of experience making mobile apps yet) despite it being better suited as a mobile app since people are slightly more likely to bring their phones to the bathroom than a computer. Maybe one day I'll turn it into a mobile app.
